In terms of planning, the agent breaks down large tasks into smaller subgoals and can reflect and refine its actions based on past experiences. Memory is divided into short-term memory, which is used for in-context learning, and long-term memory, which allows the agent to retain and recall information over extended periods. Tool use involves the agent calling external APIs for additional information. These agents have been used in various applications, including scientific discovery and generative agents simulation.\",\n",
